# Environmental Impact of Food Production Analysis

This project analyzes food production's impact on climate, water, and land use. Using key metrics, it uncovers trends and provides data-driven insights for sustainable practices.

## Overview

Food production is a major contributor to environmental degradation, affecting climate change, water scarcity, land use, and biodiversity. This project aims to analyze the environmental impact of food production using data-driven insights to promote sustainable practices.

## Objectives

- Assess the environmental impact of different food products and farming methods
- Identify patterns in carbon emissions, water usage, and land use
- Provide actionable recommendations for policymakers, food producers, and consumers
